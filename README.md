🏃‍♂️ Calorie Burn Prediction

This project predicts the number of calories burned during physical activity based on various factors such as gender, age, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature.
It uses Machine Learning regression model to train and predict calorie burn efficiently.

📚 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a model that accurately predicts calorie expenditure using health and activity data.
Such prediction can help in fitness tracking, personalized diet planning, and workout optimization.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Model training using regression algorithm

Model evaluation


🧠 Machine Learning Model Used

XGBoost Regressor

Evaluation using MAE

📈 Results

Achieved high accuracy in predicting calorie burn using the trained model.

XGBoost performed better than Linear Regression in most cases.

Visualization of feature importance and correlations provided key insights into which variables most affect calorie burn.
